    <h1 div class="H1">In Vue.js, methods are an essential part of building interactive web applications. These methods are functions that you define within a Vue component and are used to add custom behavior and logic to your application. They play a crucial role in responding to user interactions, data changes, and various events within the component.

Methods are typically defined within the methods property of a Vue component, making it easy to organize and manage the code associated with specific actions or functionalities. For instance, you can define a method to handle a button click event, validate user input, perform calculations, make HTTP requests to fetch data, or update the component's state.

Using methods helps keep your codebase clean and maintainable by separating different concerns and functionalities. Vue components leverage these methods to provide a seamless and dynamic user experience, making it easier to create complex and responsive web applications.</h1>
